# Speed Typing Test

The speed typing test is a software application that allows users to measure their typing speed and accuracy. It typically involves displaying a passage of text for the user to type and then calculating their typing speed based on the number of words typed correctly and the time taken to complete the test.

This speed typing test project was made with Python and Tkinter. It involves using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. The Tkinter library is a built-in library in Python that provides a set of functions for creating GUI applications. The project would involve designing and implementing the GUI, as well as implementing the logic for calculating typing speed and accuracy. The user would interact with the application through the GUI, typing the provided text and receiving feedback on their typing speed and accuracy.
